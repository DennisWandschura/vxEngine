-Class names start with capital letter (exceptions are replacements for stl classes)
-function names are lower case
-variable names are lower case
-names in general don't use  "_". example: "some_function" should be someFunction
-names should describe the use/intend of the class/function
-member variables start with "m_" (exceptions are Descriptors, internal classes/structs)
-global variables start with "g_"
-static variables start with "s_"

-don't comment code, instead use better names for variable/function/class

-Only use structs for:
	-Function input Descriptions
	-for things that should be publically accessable, like float3 vector
	-used only inside a class

-Functions have only a maximum of 2 input parameters
-use const ref for input only, pointer for inout

-functions that can fail should only return bool
-don't use error codes
-don't use exceptions
-if you can't recover from failure, output error msg in log and crash the program

-use msvc format

-only use inheritance, virtual funtions, etc. when neccesseray
-inheritance, only 1 level

-use empty namespace for code in source file that does not belong to the class (namespace { your code })

-Function input Description
Used for functions that have more than 2 input parameters

-raw pointers do not have ownership over the object
